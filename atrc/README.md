# ATRC

In this directory we host a specific form of running the containerised version of the PLANitOSMParserWrapper. It allows for the use of a *.yaml file to configure all parameters which are then parsed and passed on to the wrapper. This makes the wrapper compatible with the ATRC platform back-end infrastructure. 

An example on how to run the image using this approach is provided in `workflow_run_test.sh` .
